Hello from tkbctf4 team!

Let us announce that we are going to hold tkbctf4 on the 2nd and 3rd of November.<br />
On the first day will be an online CTF game, and on the second day the game (and some bonus games!) will be held at a CTF arena in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, JAPAN.<br />
For those who won't be able to visit Tsukuba on that day: Don't worry. The online game will also be held on the 3rd.

We are anxious about your participation.

That's all for now. Please stay tuned!
