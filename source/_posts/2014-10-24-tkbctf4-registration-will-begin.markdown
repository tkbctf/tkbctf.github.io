Good morning from Japan! This is Christopher, a member of tkbctf4 team.

We are very excited to tell that we are pretty much ready to accept user/team registrations!<br />
User/Team registrations will be accepted in less than 6 hours from now.

For more information, please visit [tkbctf4's scoreboard server](http://score.tkbctf.info/posts/1).

Thank you for your patience. It's coming up.


P.S.
We have previously stated that the second day of tkbctf4 (that is Nov 3) will be held at Tsukuba University, JAPAN.<br />
Well, guess what. It will be held as one of the attractions of our University's campus festival!<br />
So you can hack and slack. Cool!
